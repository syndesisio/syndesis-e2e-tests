Feature: OData Connector

  Background: Clean application state and get new key from sample service
    Given clean application state
    And deploy OData server
    And create OData credentials
    And log into the Syndesis
    And created connections
      | OData | odata | OData | sample OData service |
    And navigate to the "Home" page
    And reset OData service

#
# 1. Parameterized tests for read action.

  @integrations-odata-read
  Scenario Outline: Read <name> from OData service tests

    # Create new integration
    When click on the "Create Integration" link to create a new integration
    Then check visibility of visual integration editor
    And check that position of connection to fill is "Start"

    # Add OData connection as start step
    When selects the "OData" connection
    And select "Read" integration action
    When fill in values by element data-testid
      | resourcepath | Products        |
      | keypredicate | <key_predicate> |
      | queryparams  | <query>         |
    And click on the "Next" button

    Then check that position of connection to fill is "Finish"

    # Add Log step as finish step
    When select the "Log" connection
    And fill in values by element data-testid
