Feature: Integration - Telegram to Telegram
  #
  # Telegram is semi-automated test due to inability of telegram bots to read bot messages.
  # There is Telegram API, but it uses TCP communication with protocol MTProto and uses Type
  # Language in communication, it would be too time consuming to create telegram client just
  # for our cause. If you read this and do not agree, feel free to study:

  # https://core.telegram.org/mtproto

  #
  # P.S.: Only working example of telegram API I found slightly related to java:

  # TODO: WHEN TESTING MANUALY, THERE ARE 3 INTEGRATIONS TO TEST, READ COMMENTS IN THIS FILE
  #
  Background: Clean application state and prepare what is needed
    Given clean application state
    And log into the Syndesis
    And created connections
      | Telegram | telegram | Telegram test connection | no validation |

#
#  1. Telegram receive - publish
#
#  Instructions for semi-automatic test:
#  Just run this test, it will prepare an integration. Start the integration. Then send a telegram message "/qqq"
#  from tplevko's telegram account to channel "testBotSyndesis" and the integration should process it and send
#  the same message to channel "syndesisGroupReceive". Sending message to "syndesisGroupReceive" should not trigger any response
#  from the integration.
#
#  Currently (23.8.2018) it does not work as expected and there is a bug: https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis/issues/3168

#  Instructions for semi-automatic test:
#  Just run this test, it will prepare an integration. Start integration. Then send a message on channel "testBotSyndesis"
#  and different message on channel "syndesisGroupReceive". Then check syndesis-db if in database table contacts is
#  one new contact called Prokop and in "company" field there is your message which you sent on channel "testBotSyndesis".
#  Expected result is only one Prokop where company field equals message from "testBotSyndesis". Anything else is a bug.
#
#  This might help:
#  How to connect to syndesis-db:
#  1. forward the port to localhost: `oc port-forward syndesis-db-{insert correct numbers of your database pod here} 5432`
#  2. connect to database:     `psql -h localhost -U sampledb`
#  3. read table:  `select * from contact;` :)
